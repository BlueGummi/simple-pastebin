# simple-pastebin
A simple pastebin server, with a backend written in Rust  ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€

## How do I get this to work?

``git clone https://github.com/BlueGummi/simple-pastebin.git``

``cd simple-pastebin``

If **any** fields are missing in config.toml, all values will default. This is a FEATURE, not a BUG (trust me).

Edit config.toml with the editor of choice, it currently supports a port IP address, and a time to automatically clear the log file.
Port, IP address, and expiration in config.toml must be strings
Format the expiration like this

"2d6h2m3s"

There is also a 'log_name' variable that allows changing of the log name.
It also has to be a string, like this

"input.txt"

The 'display_data' field can be used to toggle whether or not the data received by the server will be printed.
If "true", data will be printed. All other options will not print anything.


``cargo run --release``

navigate to the IP address and port in your browser

this is also compatible with cURL

to paste data,
``curl -X POST -d "text here" <server name>``

to read the pastebin,
``curl <server name>/<log name> # an example is 127.0.0.1:5050/input.log``

to delete the pastebin,
``curl -X POST <server name>/clear``
